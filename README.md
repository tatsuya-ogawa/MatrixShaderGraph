# Matrix Shader Graph

## Overview
This Unity project experiments with recreating the classic “Matrix rain” effect using Shader Graph for Apple Vision Pro. The effect is inspired by IRCSS/MatrixVFX: <https://github.com/IRCSS/MatrixVFX/tree/master>. A short capture of the current look and feel is embedded below.

## Repository Layout
- `Assets/`: Unity project assets, Shader Graphs, materials, and example scenes.
- `RealityKitContent/`: visionOS templates and RealityKit resources generated by Unity.
- `docs/movie.mp4`: Quick demo clip showcasing the shader in Play Mode.
- `docs/movie.gif`: Lightweight animated preview for platforms that do not autoplay MP4.

## Getting Started
1. Install a Unity Editor that includes the visionOS build support modules through Unity Hub.
2. Clone or download this repository and open it as a Unity project.
3. Load the sample scene that uses the Matrix rain material.
4. Build and deploy to Vision Pro via Xcode to validate performance and depth effects.

## Notes
- Enabling visionOS builds requires the Apple visionOS packages and provisioning set up in Unity and Xcode.
- Review the license terms of the reference repository to ensure any required attributions or notices are added when distributing your build.
